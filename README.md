# Ball-collision-technology
This is a visual demonstration of Broad phase collision detection, of particles in a system of various mass 
Animation test timer - Brute force collision
Life - no visual representation for broad phase
Blocks - broad phase with visual representation of collisions
Blocks2 -simulation with various parameters of RGB red eat blue eat green eat red, shows Simple harmonic motion with varius damping with different parameters
and cool background immages from simulation
